## 🧑‍💻 About Me

> *Passionate Web3 architect building the decentralized future with security-first mindset.*

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** and over 7 years of experience building secure and scalable systems across **backend, frontend, and blockchain**.

I work on full-stack development using **Node.js, TypeScript, Go, Rust, React, NestJS, Next.js, and Docker,** .  I have deep expertise in backend architecture, distributed systems, databases, API design and smart contract development and auditing.

On the blockchain side, I specialize in **smart contract security, Ethereum, Layer 2 scaling, upgradeable contracts/proxies, cross-chain protocols, and zero-knowledge technologies**. I’ve designed and deployed **DeFi platforms, multisig wallets, and DID systems with ZK-based privacy**. 

My focus is on building robust, secure, and interoperable systems that bridge Web2 and Web3, with real-world impact.
