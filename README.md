## �� About Me

> *Passionate Web3 architect building the decentralized future with security-first mindset.*

I'm a **Senior Blockchain Engineer** with a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** and **7+ years** of experience in advanced IT projects.

I specialize in **smart contract security**, **Ethereum**, **Layer 2 scaling**, **cross-chain protocols**, **DID systems**, and **full-stack DeFi development**. Skilled in Solidity, Node.js, TypeScript, Rust, Go, and Docker, with strong expertise in zero-knowledge technologies and formal verification.

I design and deploy DeFi platforms, multisig wallets, and DID solutions with ZK-based privacy. I also lead **smart contract audits** and developed a **formal verification tool** that identifies vulnerabilities, attack patterns, and abnormal behaviors.

My work focuses on building scalable, secure, and interoperable blockchain systems that advance adoption of decentralized technologies.
