## 🧑‍💻 About Me

> *Passionate Web3 architect building the decentralized future with security-first mindset.*

**Full-Stack Engineer** with 6+ years of experience building **MVPs** and **production-ready** apps

Stack: **React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS, Go, Solidity, Docker, modern databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis), REST APIs**.

I design and develop **end-to-end applications**, from **frontend** interfaces to **backend** services. Strong experience in system design, distributed systems, microservices, APIs, and database, with a focus on scalability and reliability.

I also work on **blockchain systems**, specializing in **Solidity smart contract** development and security. Experience with **Ethereum standards** (ERC-20/4626/1155, EIP-712/2612), upgradeable contracts, Layer 2 solutions, cross-chain protocols, and zero-knowledge technologies.

I’m currently working as a **freelance engineer**, building scalable full-stack systems and contributing to open-source Web3 projects.
